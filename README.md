# WeatherApp

A simple, responsive weather application that fetches current weather and a multi-day forecast for any city using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.com/).  

> **Tribute:** This project relies on the excellent weather data provided by [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.com/) and its free-tier API.


## üîß Features

1. **Current Weather**  
   - Displays temperature, humidity, description, and an emoji for the current conditions.  
2. **5-Day Forecast**  
   - Shows a daily breakdown (roughly every 24 hours) with high/low temperatures and an emoji.  
3. **Input Validation & Error Handling**  
   - Ensures city names contain only letters, spaces, hyphens, and apostrophes.  
   - User-friendly error messages for invalid input or HTTP/API errors.  
4. **XSS Protection**  
   - All user inputs are validated and never directly injected as HTML.  
   - Displayed data comes strictly from sanitized API responses or controlled DOM updates.  
5. **Rate Limiting Awareness**  
   - Uses a single API key under free tier limits.  
   - Avoids excessive polling; only fetches data on explicit form submission.
